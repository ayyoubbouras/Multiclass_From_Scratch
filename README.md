# Multiclass_From_Scratch
## Summary :
### I programmed OnevsOne and OnevsAll from scratch 
### but my most valuable code is the one about Error Correcting Output Codes using The kernel Perceptron  using only Numpy and matplotlib for plotting , 
### I used sklearn only for the data importation so you can get rid of it If you want .
